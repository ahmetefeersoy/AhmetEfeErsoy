## 📌 Featured Projects

### VoCal – AI-Powered Voice Appointment Assistant
I developed a modular voice assistant in Python. It enables appointment scheduling using natural language, extracts key information such as date, time, and service, and saves it to the calendar with spoken feedback. It can be easily adapted to various fields such as healthcare, logistics, and maintenance.

### Task Management App – Full-Stack Authentication & CRUD System  
I developed a comprehensive task management application using modern web technologies. It features secure JWT authentication, complete CRUD operations for tasks, and real-time state management with Redux. The system includes form validation using Zod schemas, containerized deployment with Docker, and comprehensive API documentation with Swagger. Built with React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and Prisma ORM for seamless database operations.  

### Artificial Intelligence Supported Technology Management Platform
This is my graduation project developed as part of the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TUSAŞ) Lift-Up program. The platform, developed with React.js and Node.js, allows users to add and rate technologies, and generate data visualization with infographics. Relevant web publications are filtered and presented using AI, LLM, and NLP.

### Finance Copilot – AI-Powered Personal Finance Assistant
A financial assistant developed with Node.js, Python, and Google Gemini LLM. It analyzes bank statements (PDFs, images), classifies transactions, and visualizes expenses. The React.js dashboard provides personalized budgets, investment recommendations, and risk profiles. Data is stored in MongoDB.

### LLM-Powered Natural Language to SQL Query Tool
This tool I developed using Python on Google Colab. Using Google Gemini LLM, it translates natural language into SQL queries and runs them on user-installed SQLite databases. The multilingual Gradio interface simplifies structured data access for those without SQL knowledge.

### WatchHub Film Application (iOS Application)
A full-stack mobile application that allows browsing and commenting on movie trailers. Developed using React Native and ASP.NET Core (MVC), managed with a SQL database, and hosted scalably on AWS.

### UNO Card Game
A desktop UNO game developed using object-oriented programming principles in Java. Packaged as an executable application that provides a graphical user interface, full game logic, and interactive gameplay.
